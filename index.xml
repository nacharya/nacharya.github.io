Choice and correct use of an appropriate pattern is really important when building large software systems
1. Layered Architecture A system is separated into sub-systems as distictictly different layers that communicates to each other layer it is adjacent to.
A very common example of Architecture is the following list of layers
Presentation Layer Business Layer Persistence Layer Database Layer A very widely used pattern that includes UI patterns like MVP as it allows for the separation of Data Layer, Business Logic layer and User Presentation (UI) layers Each layer having a distinct responsibility makes it so the changes in one layer will only impact the adjacent layer and not all the components of the system</description></item><item><title>llm</title><link>https://nacharya.github.io/posts/llm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 11:50:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nacharya.github.io/posts/llm/</guid><description>Scope Given there is so much information available in the Internet on Generative AI, let&amp;rsquo;s keep this brief and to the point of relevant topics.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start by asking ChatGPT ChatGPT : What is Large Language Model ?
A large language model, often referred to simply as an &amp;ldquo;LLM,&amp;rdquo; is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model designed to understand and generate human language&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.

Any large complex probelem can be broken down into smaller problem tasks that can be handled concurrently. This also allows applications to be faster and scale efficiently.
When tasks can be broken down into smaller tasks, responsiveness of systems can be enhanced and also create better human interactiveness.</description></item><item><title>AI AI AI</title><link>https://nacharya.github.io/posts/ai-init/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 23:24:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nacharya.github.io/posts/ai-init/</guid><description>AI, AI, AI &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.. the many different areas &amp;hellip;. and growing! One of the key achievements of AI is the rise of Human Productivity. One of the best toolset mankind can use to improve human civilization.
Given the numbers of AI publications has increased from 162,444 in 2010 to 334,497 in 2021, this is a fast moving disruptive field of Technology with rapid acceleration. It is very difficult to stay on top of the latest research in this field.</description></item><item><title>Spirit Mind Body</title><link>https://nacharya.github.io/articles/spirit-mind-body/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 16:46:13 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nacharya.github.io/articles/spirit-mind-body/</guid><description>Spirit Humans need spirit well above their mind and body. Some people call it Religion, some call it the Universal Truth. It is very difficult to describe logically, but it exists &amp;ndash; in spirit
Have been involved with multiple religious faiths, atheistic beliefs, rational scientific explanations &amp;ndash; and &amp;ndash; realized that there is this notion of spirit that every human needs
It is something up there somewhere that can only be imagined for truthfulness beyond everything</description></item><item><title>Generics in the Go Language</title><link>https://nacharya.github.io/posts/genericsgo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 14:37:03 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nacharya.github.io/posts/genericsgo/</guid><description>Generics in Go Some well known documents from the past

The Next Steps
It is December 2021 and &amp;hellip;.we have Go 1.18 beta 1 available. The Golang team is hard at work on Golang 1.18, which will be released in February 2022, and it looks like itâ€™s going to be a big one.
Once upon a time in C++, when templates were introduced, lots of templates with amazing capabilities came into light, then came STL and standardized most of it to make things extremely powerful and usable.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://nacharya.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 18:19:10 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nacharya.github.io/about/</guid><description>Data, Processing and Learning Lots of data is easy to collect. It has to be persisted somewhere. Data has to be processed to find out what is relevant. If irrelevant data is thrown away, it reduces your cost to store it, reduces the cost to mine it. Data come it many many different formats and in many different channels in the Cloud. Continuous growth of information makes things interesting and it does make you look at Technology in different curious ways.</description></item><item><title>Data Analytics Links</title><link>https://nacharya.github.io/posts/data-analytics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 15:30:09 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nacharya.github.io/posts/data-analytics/</guid><description>Some of the most useful courses online The Data Science Course 2021: Complete Data Science Bootcamp.

It has a few features worth talking about. Some of these features never existed before in Python (surprisingly!)
Structural Mattern Matching In the traditional programming languages, this is usually referred to as the switch ...case statements. Although syntactically it looks like a switch ... case statement, it is a lot more than that.
It allows you to detect and deconstruct different structures the data is defined as, and lets you use patterns of your definition.</description></item><item><title>Software Playground</title><link>https://nacharya.github.io/projects/playground/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 16:56:50 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nacharya.github.io/projects/playground/</guid><description> Mostly code playground for Technology actively used 2022 Frameworks: NodeJS, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jupyter, Hugo Languages: Go, Python3, TypeScript, C, C++, F# UI: React, Angular Data: S3 Data Access EdgeFile</description></item><item><title>WSLv2 and Windows 10 Pro</title><link>https://nacharya.github.io/posts/wsl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nacharya.github.io/posts/wsl/</guid><description>Installing WSLv2 on Windows and using Linux natively on Windows Pre-requisites Windows 10 May 2020 (2004) or Windows 10 May 2019 (1903) or Windows 10 November 2019 (1909) or later Computer with Hyper-V support for virtualization Pathces : If you have Windows revisions 1903 or 1909 make sure you can install the patches: Windows Update KB4566116

As a kid , I only saw that everyone ties in the word Architecture to Buildings and Physical Structures that somehow captures human emotions intellectually.
Folks working in Technology were a few and the word Architect was hardly used to describe anyone in the Software/IT profession.
People in the Software world have long argued the use of the word Architecture.
