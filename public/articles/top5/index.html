<p>Software Architectures are the foundations to Software systems. Choice and correct use of
an appropriate pattern is really important when building large software systems</p>
<h3 id="1-layered-architecture">
  1. Layered Architecture
  <a class="heading-link" href="#1-layered-architecture">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>A system is separated into sub-systems as distictictly different layers that communicates
to each other layer it is adjacent to.</p>
<p>A very common example of Architecture is the following list of layers</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation Layer</li>
<li>Business Layer</li>
<li>Persistence Layer</li>
<li>Database Layer</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://localhost:1313/images/layered_pic.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A very widely used pattern that includes UI patterns like MVP as it allows for the
separation of Data Layer, Business Logic layer and User Presentation (UI) layers
Each layer having a distinct responsibility makes it so the changes in one layer
will only impact the adjacent layer and not all the components of the system</p>
<p>Iterative development of each layer warrants the compatibility changes with adjacent
layers</p>
<h3 id="event-driven-architecture">
  Event Driven Architecture
  <a class="heading-link" href="#event-driven-architecture">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Production and consumption of <code>events</code> between losely coupled softare components.
The software components that produce and consume events can be very diverse but they
can still function incredibly well for high-traffic scalable systems.</p>
<p>It also allows for minimizing the dependencies to the <code>event</code> structures within certain
categories ( <code>topic</code> ) only.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:1313/images/events_pic.png" alt=""></p>
<p>One commonly used and discussed widely pattern is the CQRS pattern. This patterns allows for the
separation of write-operations ( commands ) and read-operations ( queries ).
In GraphQL terminology, read-operations are <code>Queries</code> and write-operations are <code>Mutations</code></p>
<p>One of the most important middleware here is the MessageBroker or the Pub-Sub system that all
software systems communicate through. Most commonly used ones are:
Kafka, RabbitMQ
and most commonly used protocols are:
MQTT, AMQP and STOMP</p>
<h3 id="microservices-architecture">
  Microservices Architecture
  <a class="heading-link" href="#microservices-architecture">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>In this pattern , software application is developed as a collection of services.
In this model, It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices
architecture diagrams and services independently.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:1313/images/microservices_pic.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Much of the structures around Cloud Engineering have very good automation for building
and deploying microservices to live systems withot any downtime.</p>
<p>As a modern application pattern, this is certainly one of the best patterns that
we use these days ( 2023 )</p>
<h3 id="microkernel-architecture">
  Microkernel Architecture
  <a class="heading-link" href="#microkernel-architecture">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Here we separate the main part of the software system into a <code>core</code> component
and surround it with components we call <code>Plug-in</code> .
All plugins are dependent on the core itself but isolates the dependencies across
plugins.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:1313/images/microkernel_pic.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Software lifecycle of the <code>core</code> and the <code>Plug-in</code> can be very different here. e.g. In the traditional OS, the device drivers are like <code>Plug-in</code>  and can have their own software lifecycle.</p>
<h3 id="monolithic-architecture">
  Monolithic Architecture
  <a class="heading-link" href="#monolithic-architecture">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>This pattern is the traditional model of designing sofftware applications. In this model
softwae application is developed as a single unit, one single codebase but with many different
subcomponents organized in the same codebase.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:1313/images/monolithic_pic.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All the software components in a monolithic system are interdependent
Monolitic pattern based systems are geared towards high-performance, simplicity and
a broad support for underlying hardware systems that it is dependent on.</p>
