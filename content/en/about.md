### Data, Processing and Learning

Lots of data is easy to collect. It has to be persisted somewhere. Data has to be processed to find out what is relevant. If irrelevant data is thrown away, it reduces your cost to store it, reduces the cost to mine it. Data come it many many different formats and in many different channels in the Cloud. Continuous growth of information makes things interesting and it does make you look at Technology in different curious ways.

I am fond of data as it is persisted , mined and learned from. This includes Data for Storage, Processing, Mining and building Contexts so Learning from data using AI/ML techniques becomes seamless.
