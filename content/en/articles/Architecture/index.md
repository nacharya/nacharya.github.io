## Architecture

So what is `Architecture` ? As a kid , I only saw that everyone ties in the word Architecture to Buildings and Physical Structures that somehow captures human emotions intellectually.

Folks working in Technology were a few and the word Architect was hardly used
to describe anyone in the Software/IT profession.

People in the Software world have long argued the use of the word `Architecture`.
Here are some assumptions on the definition of the word `Architecture`

- The early decisions made in a Software project constitutes the Architecture, once the project moves to the concrete development phase, it is just code.
- It is the high-level composition of the component used that evolves over time.
- A set of emails and meetings discussed over the topic where we defined "__*it*__"

It is the `It`

Whatever that `It` is, It is important. It defines where the product/project is
today and where it is headed as we move forward to the future, ultimately
to final delivery of whatver that "__*it*__" becomes.

It may sound trivial to some of you but it is not. The core aspect of thinking architecturally is making decisions on every element that is important. To continue to maintain the product is good condition, it is very important to spend time and energy to look at the continual changes from an architectural viewpoint.

There are a lot discussions, emails and documents needed on opinions, viewpoints -- counter arguments, debates to determine the best possible architectural outcome.

Yes, it is code but a lot of code and a lot of structure that eventually leads to -- Productization.
