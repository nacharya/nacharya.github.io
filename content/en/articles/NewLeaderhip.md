Given how AI has changed the scope of the Knowledge-Intensive Occupations,
the leadership of the future will need to be more adaptive , flexible and creative.

Let's hope the future leaders will be able to stay ambitious and humble at the same time.
There are fair number of leaders who are so complacent that they are not able to see the
change coming.

Let's look at a few leadership skills that will be needed in the future:

1. **Integrity in thought** - Be consistently seeking truth, even when it challenges
   oneâ€™s beliefs or interests.
2. **Innovative Problem Solving** - Be able to think outside the box and come up with
   creative solutions.
3. **Adaptability** - Be able to pivot quickly when the situation changes. Learn to 
   lower your ego and be open to new ideas.
4. **Be human, be real** - Be able to connect with people on a human level. Be empathetic
   and understanding.

So what do we hear very frequently these days ?

- `Productivity` will improve 200% or more and we will be able to do more with less.
- `Solopreneurs` will be the future of work creating unicorns.
- `No VC funding` will be needed as the AI will be able to predict the future and small business 
   will be able to grow profitably on their own.
- `Competition` will be fierce and only the best will survive when there are a lot more 
  smaller producers and a lot more consumers. 

Great points !! But will the future be utopian or dystopian ?

Given the level of anxiety is similar to what we went through at the time of the 
Internet rise of the 90s ( dotcom boot and bust ), It will all be exentually positive....
....but with a few roller coaster rides in the process. 

The future will be what we make of it ..... don't think even AI can predict that one :-)
