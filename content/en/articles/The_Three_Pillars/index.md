## The Three Pillars: Foundational Belief

Having spent many years working in the IT industry, here are some foundational pillars that have helped me all along. The industry is ever evolving and always progressing. With the rise of the internet in the '90s came the `Internet Landslide` of information and thus came the challenge of traversing this landslide

Turns out the human mind is capable of so much ... so much more. The rise of information helped create a human belief of `Always Learning`, a fundamental belief
so engrained in our inner self, that the digital world has actually helped us achieve with ease.

The three are:
- Creative Curiosity
- Drive for Excellence
- Service and Teamwork 
  
### <ins> **Creative Curiosity** </ins>

It is 2023 ...
Given that the world, societies, human perceptions are always changing at such a rapid pace, It is amazing that we can visibly realize it on our smartphones in the palm of our hands

Creative Curiosity keeps us alive, enthusiastic and in the mode of always "wanting to do", Knowledge is not just power but potential power, power results if
actions are associated with the vital knowledge.

This learning cycle on life, work, social being, health always keeps us in an elevating curve going up and keeps up with the change.

Once you are elevated enough, it is very easy to realize what is more relevant to pay attention to for a better world

Be curious, Be creative !

### <ins> **Excellence** </ins>

Anything you do, Excellence is your key. Do your very best. It may not be the best one when you start, but if you keep doing it , you will excel better .

Again, this is also an elevating curve. The more you do it , the better it gets.

Excellence evokes the courage to take the path less travelled towards a just and humane society

An iterative path to success, but always on.

### <ins> **Service** </ins>

This is one entity that allows us to be a better human. Doing good to others in need can only make this
world a better place.

It is simple, and It also helps a person's inner self. When you are doing good for others and the community, it  provides a natural sense of accomplishment. Further, It provides a healthy boost to your self-confidence, self-esteem, and life satisfaction

Service raises social awareness, human interaction skills and allows connecting with the community at large.

The most beautiful part is that people in all profession need this, and it helps build a much much socially connected valuable world for everyone
