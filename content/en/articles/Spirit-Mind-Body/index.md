## Spirit

Humans need `spirit`  well above their mind and body. Some people call it `Religion`,
some call it the `Universal Truth`. It is very difficult to describe logically, but it exists -- in `spirit`

Have been involved with multiple religious faiths, atheistic
beliefs, rational scientific explanations -- and -- realized that there is this notion of `spirit` that every human needs

It is something up there somewhere that can only be imagined for truthfulness beyond everything

## Mind

Lots of words describe this ....

Thoughts, Ideas, Notions, thinking , reasonings .....
All elements that the mind is always active on .
The biological physical element called `brain` needs to be kept healthy for this to be a superpower.

It is the middle element that looks up to the `spirit` and ensures that the `body` is healthy below

Some of the elements we go through in daily lives e.g.
anxiety, pain, dreams, depression, love, phobias, and obsessions

It all some to one one word that describes it really well -- `Consciosness`

## Body

This is the biological self of brain, head, shoulders, arms, stomach , legs
feet and lots more

A healthy mind is driven by good positive vibe spirits, and a healthy mind drives a healthy body.

Here are some core healthy habits one needs to pursue to keep the body health in a great shape

Diet , Sleep , Relationship, Meditation, Excercise

The cycle works the other way around as well.
Need a healthy body for a healthy mind and healthy mind for a positive spirit.
