## Some of the most useful courses online

- [The Data Science Course 2021: Complete Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/). The course is very precise and well organized. They have a good combination of theory with good practical examples tht are relevent today

- [Principles, Statistical and Computational Tools for Reproducible Data Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/principles-statistical-and-computational-tools-reproducible-data-science?delta=1) Harvard also has a very nice [Master's program in Data Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/applied-computation/graduate-programs/masters-data-science)

- [Berkeley Online Data Analytics Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/data/) : Berkeley also has a one year Master's program on Analytics and Data Science.
Have found the Berkeley courses to be good in terms of practicality.

## Competitions

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) : A very useful source for experimental datasets to play and see how some of the algorithms function. They have a good collection of courses, datasets and competition results. 

## Frameworks

Tools and Frameworks that are very useful in this Arena

- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- [Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/what-is-apache-kafka/)
- [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [MatPlotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

Building Cloud Frameworks with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) has been extremely useful

## Introductory IPython Notebooks

Simple notebooks to familiarize with Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Tensorflow. These notebooks can be used with Jupyter or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
