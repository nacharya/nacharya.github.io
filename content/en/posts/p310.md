## Python 3.10 is here

[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) is now released. It has a few features worth talking about. Some of these features never existed before in Python (surprisingly!)

### __Structural Mattern Matching__

In the traditional programming languages, this is usually referred to as the `switch ...case`
statements. Although syntactically it looks like a `switch ... case` statement, it is a lot more than that.

It allows you to detect and deconstruct different structures the data is defined as, and lets you
use patterns of your definition. Standard pattern matching is very literal and let's you define explicitly. All in all, it adds good power to the language

Relevant Documents:

- [Specificaiton - PEP 634](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634)
- [Motivation & Rationale - PEP 635](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0635)
- [Tutorial - PEP 636](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636)

Now let's take a look at Python Type checking using this structure. Normally, Type checking is not needed in Python, but for traditional language folks, this is a useful feature.

```python
match value:
    case str():  # Handle strings first for performance reasons.
        return value
    case bool():  # Make sure booleans don't get treated as numbers
        return str(value)
    case decimal.Decimal() | float() | int():
        if use_l10n is False:
            return str(value)
        return number_format(value, use_l10n=use_l10n)
    case datetime.datetime():
        return date_format(value, 'DATETIME_FORMAT', use_l10n=use_l10n)
    case datetime.date():
        return date_format(value, use_l10n=use_l10n)
    case datetime.time():
        return time_format(value, 'TIME_FORMAT', use_l10n=use_l10n)
    case _:
        return value
```

### __Better Error Messages__

Much of this [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.10/whatsnew/3.10.html#better-error-messages) describes the precision of the error messages. There are a lot of cases when debugging a large code base , one encounters errors that makes you wonder and guess the reasons behind the error messages.
The classic language confusion of the message `Syntax Error` is one of them .

Here is one example of a small variable definition error. A simple commonly occurring error but the messages are a lot more explicit.

```python

CountProjectOwners = 5
print(CountProject)
> NameError: name 'CountProject' is not defined. Did you mean: CountProjectOwners ?

```

Now let's look at one common scenatio of forgetting to write ":"

```python
if age > 21
    print("Age is greater than 21")
```

Now let's run this code in 3.10 and see

```bash
% python3.10 age.py
if age > 21    
         ^
SyntaxError: expected ':'
```

### __Parenthesized Context Managers__

With this feature, it allows multiple I/O streams statements to be combined in a single statement of `with`. e.g.

Say , for example, we had a line like ...

```python
with open('foo1.txt', 'r') as fooin, open('foo2.txt', 'w') as fooout:
    foout.write(fooin.read())
```

If this line is too long, we can split it using the traditional approach of using backslash `\`
e.g.

```python
with open('foo1.txt', 'r') as fooin, \
     open('foo2.txt', 'w') as fooout:
    fooout.write(fooin.read())
```

With this new feature, the line can be split across multiple lines and kept within a pair of
parentheses. e.g.

```python
with (open('foo1.txt', 'r') as fooin,
      open('foo2.txt', 'w') as fooout):
    fooout.write(fooin.read())
```

Simple, but makes the code readable and clean.

### __Type Unions__

There are a lot of cases where the data types itself are not precisely known but the
function can complete execution  within certain boundaries. e.g.

```python
def f(x: int | float) -> float:    return x * 3.142f(1)  
```

this function will execute for both `int` and `float` as arguments, but will fail for `str`

```python

f(3) # pass
f(5.5) # pass
f("hello")  # fail

```
